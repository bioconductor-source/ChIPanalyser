\description{
Accessor Method for a \code{PWMpseudocount} slot in a
\code{\link{parameterOptions}}
}
\usage{
PWMpseudocount(object)
}

\arguments{
    \item{object}{
    \code{object} is a \code{\link{parameterOptions}} object.
    }
}
\details{
In the context of Position Weight Matricies, the pseudocount is used
to avoid 0 probabilities during the transformation of
Position Frequency Matrix to a Position Probability Matrix and finally to a
Postion Weight Matrix. It is essentially a sample correction that is added
in the case of small sample size. The effect of the base pair to which a
pseudocount was assigned will not influence the model nor will create
mathematical issues such as infinities or zero division. Default is set at 1.
