\description{
Setter Method for the \code{pseudocount} slot in a
\code{\link{parameterOptions}} object
}
\usage{
PWMpseudocount(object) <- value
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
    \item{object}{
    \code{object} is a \code{\link{parameterOptions}} object
    }
    \item{value}{
    \code{value} is a numeric value that will be assigned to the
    \code{pseudocount} slot. Defualt is set at 1
    }
}
\details{
In the context of Position Weight Matricies, the pseudocount is used to
avoid 0 probabilities during the transformation of Position Frequency Matrix
to a Position Probability Matrix and finally to a Postion Weight Matrix.
It is essentially a sample correction that is added in the case of small
sample size. The effect of the base pair to which a pseudocount was
assigned will not influence the model nor will create mathematical issues
such as infinities or zero division.
}
\value{
Returns a \code{parameterOptions} object with an updated value for
the \code{pseudocount} slot.
